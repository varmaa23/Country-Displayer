It's interesting how countries with some of the lowest AccessToElectricity values have the extremely high RenewableEnergy values (Burundi, Chad, Malawi, Liberia, South Sudan, Dem. Republic of the Congo...). Perhaps it's because fossil fuels are more expensive that renewable energy (wind and solar energy are cheaper than fossil fuels). Also, I assume that most of the people utilizing Renewable Energy would be richer and have access to that kind of energy (might be in the cities or live in nicer housing). I would be interested to see what kind of Renewable Energy sources that these countries utilize. 
It's also interesting how many Middle Eastern countries are placed in the Top Population growth, especially since many of them are extremely small. Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Jordan, and Lebanon reside amongst the top 10 countries. It would be interesting to understand why these countries are undergoing increases in population (perhaps some law or change in custom).
